
*****************
* Version 2.7   *
*****************

marcelognunez add:
	In Cirsim.java:
	- dumpCircuit and readOptions (save and open files) now implements grid and grid size.
	originally created by errtee.
	- the updateCircuit code inherent about grid is in new function "grid()"
	(must call setGrid() before this func. in order to avoid freezing issues.)
	- functions involved in these funcionalities are.
	init()
	dumpCircuit()
	itemStateChanged() [for signal management]
	readOptions()
	readSetup()
	doSave()
	updateCircuit()
	stoppedCheck

	I added modules from CircuitJS project (lushprojects.com)
	- Box
	- AM Source
	- FM Source
	- Tristate Buffer
	- Schmitt Trigger Buffer (Non-Inverting)
	- T Flip-Flop
	- Multiplexer
	- Demultiplexer
	- SIPO Shift Register
	- PISO Shift Register
	- Sequence Generator
	- Full Adder
	- Half Adder
	- Monostable

	Compatibility backward with CMF format
	- Maintaining the dumpfile numbers.

	Now CHANGES are unified in Internation English for all collaborators.


federoggio add:
	If Character error in development make in Eclipse:
	File->Properties-> (set character set in UTF-8)

	- EditDialog.java in problems, when you put 100 in ohms in resistor, it set 99.8 ohms.



errtee add:
	2016-01-04:
	bugfixes
	========
	resize window to 0 -> stack trace
	select in options menu -> mouse mode = 0

	improvements
	============
	a grid is shown

	all shortcuts work
	  'A';AntennaElm
	  'a';OpAmpElm
	  'c';CapacitorElm
	  'd';DiodeElm
	  'f';NMosfetElm
	  'g';GroundElm
	  'i';CurrentElm
	  'I';InverterElm
	  'j';NJfetElm
	  'l';InductorElm
	  'L';LogicInputElm
	  'M';LogicOutputElm
	  'm';MemristorElm
	  'O';OutputElm
	  'p';ProbeElm
	  'R';RailElm
	  'r';ResistorElm
	  'S';Switch2Elm
	  's';SwitchElm
	  'T';TransformerElm
	  't';NTransistorElm
	  'v';VoltageElm
	  'w';WireElm
	  'x';TextElm
	  'z';ZenerElm

	circuitChanged behaves right (I hope)
	can move elements with arrow keys
	Alt+TAB (Alt+Shift+TAB) cyclic selects elements

	Help->Keyboard Shortcuts
	    reads file shortcuts.txt

	New Look and feel: Metal (avoid linux compilation problem.)







*****************
* Version 2.6   *
*****************

fgg192 agregó:
	-Add of ChangesAssociations=yes in INNO setup iss file
	-Improvements of performance in CirSim.java

federoggio agregó:
	-Reducing of "deprecates" methods in CirSim.java and Circuit.java
	-New splash graphics (logo.png)
	-The module Circuit.java go to be called CircuitMod.java
		(Future compatibility with MacOS X)
	-Creation of Wrapper and Install for MacOS X 10.6 (pmdoc file)
	 (It needed MacOS X 10.6 with Xcode, in Developer/Application/Utilities
	  there is two applications (Jar Bundler y PackageMaker).
	  With Jar Bundler is necessary add the folder "circuits" before
	  generate the *.app. see content and copy/paste the folder for add it.


*****************
* Version 2.5.1 *
*****************

fgg192 agregó:
	-Add Help->About.
	-Add File->New.
	-Deletion of Blank Circuit.
	-Check up of the file at load.
	-Add v2.5 to the splash screen.
	-Move of pushUndo() from mousePressed(MouseEvent e) to the end of method.

federoggio agregó:
	-Open thru shell on Windows in INNO Setup.
	-Improvements in the circuits (Circuits->Logic Transistors)


***************
* Version 2.5 *
***************

fgg192 agregó:
	-Creation of a saving system in .CMF format
	-Saving check out of file when open files and close application.
	-Loading of file from Explorer (Windows); when select "Open" a cmf file from explorer open the app
	and load the circuit. Regedit entries has been created that associate the format in the application.
	-Deletion of menus Import and Export.
	-Maximize window
	-Replace of LeyListener by KeyboardFocusManager. This form avoid the selection of canvas's area for keyboard
	use at startup; the keyboard work from start.
	-Add functionality of DELETE (checkup)
	-Add logo at startup when is loading.
	-Add of icons to the frame.


federoggio agregó:
	-Development Website: http://circuitmod.sourceforge.net/
	-Window title: CircuitMod v2.5
	-Add menu and module: InverterSTElm.java (filecode:186)
		(Logic Gates->Add ST Inverter)
	-Add proof circuit: ST Inverter (setuplist.txt -> osc-st.txt)
		(Circuits->Misc Devices->Schmitt Trigger Osc)
	-Add ChipCDElm.java for CD4000 series
	-Proof add (Sequencial Logic->Counter->4511 Full Test)
	-4017 simulation issues (now actuate as must be)
	-Open by Shell (Error still) in INNO Setup file.
